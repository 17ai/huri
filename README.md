# huri

> A long time ago, there was a girl named Huri. Huri’s mother loved her daughter very much, and she always praised Huri. Huri’s mother stopped everybody who passed. She would point at the chair where Huri was sitting. She would say, “That’s my beautiful, hardworking Huri!” Huri always sat outside. She sometimes took naps in her chair. Other times, she sang simple songs. And Huri’s mother praised her hard work and beauty. All of the people in the town listened to Huri’s mother speak of how hard Huri worked. But they were confused; no one ever saw Huri do any work. Soon, the people in town began to giggle when Huri’s mother praised Huri. When they saw her, they whispered, “Here comes Lazy Huri’s mother.” One day, a stranger came into the town. When Huri’s mother saw him, she told him about Huri. She said, “My daughter is very beautiful and hardworking.” The next day, the man visited the king; he was the king’s messenger. He told the king about the beautiful and hardworking girl. The king said, “My son, the prince, will marry this hardworking girl!” The very next week, the prince and Huri were married! Everybody thought that Huri’s mother had planned the whole thing. That is why she had lied about how hard Huri worked; she did it to trick the prince! People sometimes asked Huri’s mother if she had tricked the prince into marrying her daughter. But she never admitted it. She only smiled and winked.
